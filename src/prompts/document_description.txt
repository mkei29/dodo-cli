Read the content of a document from dodo-doc
---
This tool retrieves the full content of a document hosted on dodo, a document hosting service.
It returns the document's native Markdown content.

WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:

Always use this tool immediately after receiving search results when:
- You need the complete content of a document to answer the user's question
- The search results preview is insufficient to provide a thorough answer
- The user explicitly asks for details that require reading the full document
- You need to understand implementation details, specifications, or design decisions

USAGE WORKFLOW:
1. First, use the "search" tool to find relevant documents
2. Review the search results and identify which documents are most relevant
3. Use this tool to read the full content of selected documents
4. Provide comprehensive answers based on the complete document content

The document URL parameter comes from the "url" field in search results.

PRIORITY: Always read the full document rather than relying solely on search result snippets when providing detailed answers or recommendations.
