Search documents from the dodo-doc.
---
dodo is a service that hosts users' documents.
This tool searches for documents across the entire dodo platform based on a given query.
You can use this tool to search for user-specific knowledge, design documents, or any specialized expertise.
After you receive the search results, you can use the "read_document" tool to read the content of a specific document.


Search results are returned in json format with the following structure:
{
"items": [
{
"title": "document title",
"contents": "document contents",
"id": "document id",
"project_id": "project id",
"project_slug": "project slug",
"url": "document url"
}
]
}

WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:

Always use this tool FIRST when:
- The user asks about documentation, specs, or design documents
- The user mentions "dodo" or asks about documents hosted on dodo
- The user asks questions that might be answered by team knowledge or project documentation
- You need context about a project's architecture, decisions, or specifications
- The user asks "how does X work?" or "what is the approach for Y?" where X or Y might be documented

Proactively search dodo when:
- Starting work on a new feature or codebase area that might have documentation
- The user's question seems to require domain-specific knowledge
- You're unsure about implementation details that teams typically document
- The user mentions terms like "design doc", "RFC", "spec", "documentation", or "wiki"

PRIORITY: Always prefer searching dodo over making assumptions. If relevant documentation exists, it will provide more accurate and contextual information than generic responses.
