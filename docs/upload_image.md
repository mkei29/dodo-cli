This page explains how to upload images for use in your documentation.

## Write the configuration

To upload images, add an `assets` section to your `.dodo.yaml`.
In this section, list the files you want to upload as an array.
You can also use glob patterns to include multiple files that match a pattern.

```yaml
version: 1
project:
  project_id: "document"
  name: dodo
  version: 0.0.1
pages:
  - markdown: docs/index.md
assets:
  - "assets/**"
```

The following file formats are currently supported by dodo-doc:

* image/jpeg
* image/png
* image/gif
* image/webp
* image/tiff
* image/bmp

## Write the Markdown

Once uploaded, your image files can be referenced directly from Markdown.
Use the same paths you specified under `assets`. In the example below, we display `assets/preview.png`:

```markdown
![preview](assets/preview.png)
```

After uploading, the image will render like this:

![preview](assets/preview.png)
