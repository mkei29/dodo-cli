To use dodo, you need to complete two initial setup steps:

* Create a new project
* Install the dodo-cli

Let's look at each of these in detail.

## Creating a New Project
To host documents, you first need to create a project.
Let's start by creating a Dodo account and setting up a project.
Please sign up for Dodo using the link below:

https://www.dodo-doc.com/signup

After completing the signup process, you will automatically be redirected to the dashboard.
Click the `Create a new project` button and open the dialog.
Fill out the form in the dialog and click the `Create` button.
With this, your project setup is complete.

## Installing dodo-cli
Next, let's install the dodo-cli.
The installation method varies depending on your operating system.

### Linux or Mac OS
If you're using Linux or Mac OS, you can download dodo-cli with the following command:
The dodo-cli will be downloaded to your current directory. If needed, copy it to a directory in your execution path.

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toritoritori29/dodo-cli/main/download.sh | sh -
```

### Windows
Currently, we don't have a download script prepared for Windows.
Please download the binary that corresponds to your architecture from the GitHub release page.

## Next Step
This completes the setup. In the next chapter, let's try actually uploading a document to dodo.
