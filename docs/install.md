## Installing the dodo CLI

### Install via npm

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @dodo-doc/cli
```

### Download a binary

Alternatively, download a prebuilt binary from the releases page and place it somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):

https://github.com/mkei29/dodo-cli/releases

### Check it works
Run `dodo version` to confirm the installation was successful.
Other commands require an API key — see the Quick Start for details.

```bash
dodo version
```
