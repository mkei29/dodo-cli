### Install via npm

### Download a binary

Alternatively, download a prebuilt binary from the releases page and place it somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):

https://github.com/mkei29/dodo-cli/releases

### Check it works
Run dodo version to confirm the installation was successful.
Other commands require an API key — see the Quick Start for details.

```bash
dodo version
```
