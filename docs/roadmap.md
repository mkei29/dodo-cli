## More User-Friendly and Secure Authentication

Right now, dodo-doc supports login via Google OIDC.
Because session durations are relatively short, this can feel inconvenient.
This task will enhance our authentication flow so a wider range of people can use dodo-doc comfortably and securely.

## Paid Plans

We currently offer a free plan intended for individual use.
We’re developing a **Team** plan for shared use. In addition to supporting multiple users, this plan will raise various limits compared to the individual plan—for example, the preview window and the number of previews.

# Planned

## API Features

Making uploaded documents accessible via an API will enable integrations with LLMs for coding automation and make it convenient to use dodo-doc as a CMS.
In this task, we’ll make the dodo-doc API public so more users can build on it.

## AI Features

We will strengthen our AI integrations. We plan to improve the existing MCP functionality so accumulated knowledge is easier for Coding Agents to use.
We’ll also implement a basic chatbot and automatic translation so people can read documentation in multiple languages more easily.
