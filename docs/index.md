# Main Features of dodo
dodo's key features are as follows:

* **Developer-friendly**: Since you only need to upload Markdown, it's easy to integrate into existing development pipelines.
* **Easy setup**: You can generate a configuration file template using the init command of the dodo-cli.
* **CI/CD**: Building a CI/CD environment is simple as you can upload documents with a single binary.
* **Private option**: You can set documents to private. This makes it suitable for personal use, such as keeping a diary.

We are also currently developing the following features.
For details, please refer to [the roadmap page](/roadmap).

* Cross-document search
